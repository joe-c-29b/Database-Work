KNOWLEDGE BASE
The Knowledge module serves as a location for ServiceNow users to compile articles, FAQs, and solutions, as well as ask questions within their Instance to other users.
All users have access to the OSOS Knowledge base, VoteWA Knowledge base, and the Address Confidentiality Program Knowledge base.  It is strongly advised not to utilize the OSOS and VoteWA Knowledge bases. The articles located within are specific to their departments and do not pertain to anything within the ACP Domain of the database.
Select the ACP Knowledge base block to enter the knowledge base, or check off the subscribe option located within to receive alerts to articles or questions posted within.
Once inside the knowledge base, your view should look similar to below
