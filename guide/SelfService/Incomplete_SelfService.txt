Self Service

Self-Service
The Self-Service module is available for every ServiceNow user, although the applications contained may vary. Due to the specialization of the confidentiality of the ACP's work and the specialization of their ServiceNow Database, not all of the Self-Service applications are useful.  Below are the XX applications that all ACP users should know:
-Homepage
-Dashboards
-Service Catalog
-Knowledge
-Visual Task Boards
-Incidents
-My Profile
-My Knowledge Articles
-My Assets
-My Notification Preferences
More information about each of the sections can be found in the "Self-Service" section of the manual.


THE Homepage
The homepage is a 100% user customized module.  A new user will have an almost blank homepage, with the exception of the light gray bar running across the top of the area.
Below are options present on the light gray bar:
-Dashboard menu
-Dashboards overview
-Current Dashboard Name
-Change dashboard
-Add widgets
-Sharing
-Configuration

Selecting the "Dashboard Menu" will open a drop down list of options.  Below are the options with their respective functions:
-New Dashboard; begin a new customized dashboard, starting from scratch
-Dashboard Properties; view/edit the Name, Order, Status, Owner, roles required, sources, and tabs of the current dashboard
-Delete Dashboard; delete the current dashboard
-Duplicate Dashboard; duplicate the current dashboard
-Copy Dashboard URL; copy the URL of the current dashboard to your clipboard
-Create Favorite; create a favorite that can be added to a user's "Favorites" menu
-Create Tab; create an additional tab for the current dashboard
-Refresh; refresh the widgets on the current dashboard
-Reset Filters; reset all filters that are currently applied to the widgets on the current dashboard

Selecting the "Dashboards Overview" will bring you the the "Dashboards" page where a user can sort/ filter the dashboards that they have access to based on: owner, group, and name.
This page also has a "Create Dashboard" button in the top right corner.  This will open up a blank "Dashboard Properties" record that, once saved will create a new blank dashboard for a user to customize.

The "Current Dashboard Name" is not an option, rather the title of the current dashboard a user is currently located on. It is important to name each dashboard you create so that they can be easily distinguished between based on the name rather than the contents.

Selecting the "Change Dashboard" option will open a drown down filter and list of all dashboards available to a user to select from.
IMPORTANT NOTICE: a user's homepage will always navigate to the most recent dashboard selected for view.

Selecting the "Sharing" option will open a side bar with options to invite other users to view the dashboard based on group, role, or just individual user.
