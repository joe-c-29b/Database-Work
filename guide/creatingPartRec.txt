CREATING A PARTICIPANT RECORD

Below is a picture of a blank participant record

The fields with red asterisks next to them are required in order to create/save a new record.  
Those fields are:
	-First Name
	-Last Name
	-DOB
Additionally, there are 7 fields that cannot be filled in by the user because they are system populated.
Those fields are:
	-PMB (is automatically created after the record is certified)
	-Status (Pending, Active, Inactive, Denied)
	-AA Status (is taken from the AA table)
	-PRV tab (PRV field on Supplemental Information tab must be manually entered0

After the mandatory fields have been completed, you are able to select the "save" button in the top right of the window.
	*If you have not completed all of the mandatory fields you will receive a red error banner across the top of the window telling you which fields need to be completed.
The window will briefly refresh, populating the "Status" field to "Pending", at which point a new section will appear at the bottom of the record and 3 more fields will become mandatory.
Those fields are:
	-Residence Address
	-Abuser Law Enforcement
	-Classification Type
Once the those fields have been completed the "Certify" button is able to be selected and the individual for which the record is being created is now an "Active Participant".
The system will update the "Status" field to "Active" and populate the "PMB" field with the next available PMB number.
