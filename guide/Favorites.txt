Creating Favorites

What is a Favorite?
A "Favorite" is a saved location and view within the ACP Domain that can be accessed directly from your "Favorites" tab without requiring additional filters or search criteria.
An example would be a Favorite named "Yesterday's Enrollments" which is a saved view of the Participants Table that is already filtered for PMBs with a "Start Date" of "yesterday"
"Favorites" are a good way to speed up your daily work and customize your specific account to best fit your own needs.
